# A Pharma Case Study
The pharmaceutical company Sun Pharma is manufacturing a new batch of painkiller medications, which are due for testing. Around 80,000 new products are created and need to be tested for their time of effect (which is measured as the time taken for the medicine to show effects) as well as quality assurance (which tells you whether the medicine was able to do a satisfactory job).
My job was to find the theoretical probability that at most 3 medicines do not work satisfactorily, the time interval between which the medicine performs better, and conduct hypothesis testing to find if the medicines can perform satisfactorily or not.
